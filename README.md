- Hi there! You probably know me as @sugawara.koushi#1402 from the official Risk and Custom Risk Maps servers! Please, feel free to call me Suga

- Please make sure you have finished installing the application at https://sourceforge.net/projects/domination/

- I'm new to GitHub, so these files may be corrupted as all heck for all I know, but if they're not... I hope you have fun~

- To start playing on my maps, select the Domination icon, then hit New Game. You should then be able to choose the map, cards, card bonus settings, among other things.

- This game software is NOT MINE and I DID NOT MAKE IT, I only made the maps and made them playable.

- For any concerns, dm me on Discord! I'm always at most one sleep cycle away from responding, so please do message me.
