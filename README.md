- Hi there! You probably know me as @sugawara.koushi#1402 from the official Risk server! Please, feel free to call me Suga.

- Please make sure you have finished installing the application at https://sourceforge.net/projects/domination/ before downloading any of the maps or map packs!

- I'm new to GitHub, so these files may be corrupted as all heck for all I know, but if they're not... I hope you have fun~



INSTRUCTIONS:

- To start playing on my maps, first extract the .zip file, and move only the content of it into the maps folder present in the Domination folder. You can now select the Delect the Domination icon, and hit New Game. You should then be able to choose the map, cards, card bonus settings, among other specifications.



DISCLAIMERS:

- This game software is NOT MINE and I DID NOT MAKE IT, I only made the map artwork and made them playable. The software is officially owned (I believe) by yuranet. If not, please message me, and I will fix this mistake ASAP.

- I am NOT an official spokesperson, creator, coder, or mod for Risk, SMG, Hasbro, yuranet, or any Discord servers. Basically, if a person would usually be paid by SMG or yuranet to answer your question or file a complaint or suggestion... yeah, wrong person.

- This software is modifyable according to official TOS I'm not legally smart enough to understand, and my maps are open to modification as long as it isn't considered offensive. General rule of thumb for this: if your grandma wouldn't approve of a 10-year-old seeing it, please don't make it. Otherwise, please give me some credit as the maker of the original map too.



CONTACTS:

- For any concerns, dm me on Discord anytime! My username is @sugawara.koushi#1402, and I'm always at most one sleep cycle away from responding, so please do message me.
